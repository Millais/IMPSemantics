## IMP Extensions Using Haskell

This assignment focused on implementing the denotational semantics of IMP using Haskell (as part of [CM20218](http://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2014-2015/cm/CM20218.html): *Foundations of Computation II*). 

The full specification is included in the PDF. In summary this included:

* Elaborating on arithmetic expressions and the construction of pre-increment/pre-decrement operators.
* Implementing boolean expressions, with an emphasis on short-circuit and eager evaluation.
* Interpretation and implementation of the commands for typical control statements: skip, branching (if-then-else), and looping (while-do).

Graded as a strong first.
